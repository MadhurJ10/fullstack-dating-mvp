Submission Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a Full Stack Dating MVP where users authenticate using Google OAuth, discover other users,
like profiles, and get matched when the interest is mutual.

The primary focus of this project was:

- Clean backend architecture
- Secure OAuth implementation
- Clear user interaction flow
- Fast execution and deployment

## 2. Features Implemented

- JWT-based stateless authentication
- User discovery (excluding the logged-in user)
- Like system with duplicate-like prevention
- Automatic match creation on mutual likes
- Matches listing
